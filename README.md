# Agentic AI Projects

This repository is dedicated to exploring and building Agentic AI systemsâ€”autonomous agents capable of performing tasks with minimal human intervention. It serves as a platform for experimentation, learning, and demonstrating the capabilities of intelligent agents in real-world scenarios. The projects here focus on leveraging advanced AI tools and frameworks to create systems that can understand, reason, and act autonomously. This repository is intended to showcase practical applications, encourage hands-on development, and provide insights into the growing field of Agentic AI.
